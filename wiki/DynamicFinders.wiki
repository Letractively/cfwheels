#summary Make your code more readable by using dynamic finders.
#labels chapter,0.8

With the recent introduction of `onMissingMethod` in ColdFusion 8 (Thanks Adobe!) we have now been able to port over the concept of dynamic finders from Rails to Wheels.

==What are Dynamic Finders?==

The concept is simple... instead of using arguments to tell Wheels what you want to do you can use a dynamically named function. For example, the following code:{{{
verbatim code block

{{{
<cfset me = model("Song").findOne(where="email='my@myself.com'")>
}}}

Can also be written as:

{{{
<cfset me = model("Song").findOneByEmail("my@myself.com")>
}}}

Through the power of `onMissingMethod` Wheels will parse the function name and figure out that the value supplied is supposed to be matched against the `email` column.
