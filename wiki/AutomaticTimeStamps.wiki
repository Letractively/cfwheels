#summary Let Wheels handle time stamping of records.
#labels chapter,0.8

When working with database tables it is very common to have a column that holds the time that the record was added or last modified. If you have an e-commerce website with an orders table you want to store the date and time the order was made, if you run a blog you want to know when someone left a comment and so on. As with anything that is a common task performed by many developers it makes a good candidate for abstracting to the framework level, so that's what we did...

==Columns Used for Timestamps==

If you have any of the following columns in your database table Wheels will see them and treat them a little differently than others:

===createdAt===

If Wheels sees this column in your table it will use it to store the current date and time when an `INSERT` operation is made (which could happen through a save() or create() operation for example).

===updatedAt===

If Wheels sees this column it will use it to store the current date and time when an `UPDATE` operation is made (which could happen through a save() or update() operation for example).

If you add any of these columns to your table, make sure they can accept date values (like `datetime` or `timestamp` for example) and that they can be set to `null`.
