#summary Stop repeating yourself with the use of filters and verifications.

If you find the need to run a piece of code before or after several controller actions, then you can use _filters_ to accomplish this without having to explicitly call the code inside each action in question.

This is similar to using the `onRequestStart` / `onRequestEnd` functions in !ColdFusion's `Application.cfc` file, with the difference being that filters tie in better with your Wheels controller setup.
