Here's a quick example of utilizing the sendEmail() function and a
preferraable way of using application scope variables for server info.

In the config/settings.cfm, four new variables are inserted as
follows:

<cfset application.settings.email.server = "_your_mail_server_here_">
<cfset application.settings.email.username = "_email_username_here_">
<cfset application.settings.email.password = "_email_password_here_">
<cfset application.settings.email.from =
"_address_@_domainname_here_.com">

The sendMail() function call would then look something like this:

<cfset sendEmail(
  template="_custom_template_",
  server="#application.settings.email.server#",
  username="#application.settings.email.username#",
  password="#application.settings.email.password#",
  from="#application.settings.email.from#",
  type="html",
  to="_recipient_email_here",
  subject="Test Subject from Wheels",
  customMessage="Test Email Message Body")>

The template attribute set in the above example to _custom_template_
is a .cfm placed within the "template" folder under the controller
executing this code. For example, if the sendEail was sent from the
Emailer.cfc controller, then the _custom_template .cfm will be under
views/emailer/template/_custom_template_.cfm

Hopefully this helps those of you who haven't tried this tag out yet
or hadn't yet figured out all the attributes.

Something else I might have left off was an ample explanation of the
field "customMessage".

The beauty of using Wheels' sendEmail is that the main, generally
similar email layout, content, etc, only has to be used once in the
template. Rather than with a standard CFMail tag which you would have
to copy and paste the same general content (header, footer, graphics,
etc.) for each use.

Any variable can be passed to the email template (that is, you have a
#_yourvariable_# in it) via the sendMail function.

In a number of uses, I utilize passing in firstName, lastName, and
customMessage variables that are integrated into the basic project
email template of Wheels.
