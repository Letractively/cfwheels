Partials is a concept in Wheels that takes good old `cfinclude` and makes it understand other Wheels concepts (like layouts and caching) and while doing so adds a few cool things in the process (like the ability to pass in a query and have it call the partial file on each iteration to name one).

==So, What's a Partial?==

same part from multiple pages - useful with partials.
also useful to just break up pages into more manageable pieces so you can focus on each part indivdually.
any args passed in will be var scoped and placed in a var with the same name as the partial
can also access the view variables but cleaner to use local vars (no conflits, leads to bugs etc)

==Storing Your Partial Files==

identified by prepending with an underscore in the file name (but referenced without it in the code)
Can also share partials between controllers, normal to place them in its own folder then. Rendering follows the rule for renderPage(template)?


==Rendering or Including?==
can also use the partials directly from the controller using renderpartial. Useful for ajax calls, inlcude example with blog comments.

==Partials with Layouts==
it's possible to use partials from layouts as well

==Caching a Partial==

==Using Partials with an Object==
can pass in partial=object and the partial "article" (name of object) will be used and the local var article set.

==Using Partials with a Query==

can pass in the query and it will loop through and call each partial, will also set a counter variable (possible to get name of the query?).or is it better to pass in "article" and Wheels will look for an object named article, probably not.

Also implement spacerTemplate. should accept straight html or a file name. no vars need to be passed to it.
