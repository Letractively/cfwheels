#labels model,tutorial
Objects in Wheels have attributes that correspond to the columns in the table it maps to.
The first time (or every time if you're in development mode) you call a method on a model Wheels will reflect on the schema inside the database for the model's table and extract all the column information.
To keep things as simple as possible there are no getters or setters in Wheels, instead all the attributes are made available in the `this` scope.
Nothing is stopping you from creating these on your own though if this is something you're used to having.
