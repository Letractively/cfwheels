#summary Making URLs prettier using URL rewriting.
#labels chapter,0.8

URL rewriting is a completely optional feature of Wheels, and all it does is get rid of the `index.cfm` part of the URL.

For example, with URL rewriting off, a URL in your application cold look like this:

{{{
http://localhost/index.cfm/blog/new
}}}

After turning on URL rewriting, it would look like this:

{{{
http://localhost/blog/new
}}}

Combine this with the routing functionality of Wheels, and you get the capablility of creating some really human-friendly (easier to remember, say over the phone, etc.) and search engine friendly URLs (easier to crawl, higher PageRank etc.).

Unfortunately if you're running your Wheels powered site in a sub folder of another site you will not be able to turn on URL rewriting so we recommend running the Wheels site as a stand-alone site whenever possible. If you've met this one requirement and want the shortest and prettiest URLs possible, then just follow the instructions below.

==Instructions for Apache==

First, check that the Apache `rewrite_module` has been loaded by ensuring there is no pound signs before the line that says `LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so` in the `httpd.conf` file.

Next, make sure that Apache has permission to load the rewrite rules from the `.htaccess` file in the web root. This is done by setting `AllowOverride` to `All` under the `Directory` section corresponding to the website yo plan on using Wheels on (still inside the `httpd.conf` file).

Finally, uncomment the rewrite rules inside the `.htaccess` file itself located in the web root (remove the pound signs). For some Apache setups this is actually the only thing you have to do.

==Instructions for IIS==

Unfortunately there is no built-in URL rewriting mechanism in IIS so getting Wheels working with pretty URLs is a little more complicated than with Apache. Here's what you do:

First, download "Ionic's ISAPI Rewrite Filter" from [http://cheeso.members.winisp.net/IIRF.aspx]. Unzip the file and put the `.dll` file in the root of your website (it has to be in the same folder as the `IsapiRewrite4.ini` file). To enable the rewrite filter in IIS you click on `Properties` for your website, then go to the `ISAPI Filters` tab and click the `Add...` button. Type in anything you want as the `Filter Name` and point the `Executable` to the `IsapiRewrite4.dll` file.

Now restart your web server and enjoy those fancy new URLs :)
