#summary Introduction to how you validate model objects before saving them.

= Introduction =

Before Wheels saves an obect to the database, either by inserting a new record or updating
an existing one, it always validates it to the rules you have specified in your model
file. If any errors are found during validation the object does not get saved to the
database and instead error information is added to the object. You can then use this
information and display them as error messages to the user.
