#summary Instruction for installing Wheels on Apache and IIS.

= Installing Wheels =

If you've ever installed a framework then you know it's generally pretty easy: copy a few files, maybe add a mapping in the !ColdFusion Administrator and you're off and running. Wheels is no different. If you've never installed a framework before, don’t worry. You might even enjoy the process! All right, "enjoy" is a strong word. Maybe "tolerate".

We have tried to make it extremely simple to get up and running with Wheels - there actually only two things you need to do before you can start working on your app (although  you can tweak your installation later on by for example introducing URL rewriting and moving the Wheels core files out of your application's folder).

 * Get the latest Wheels release and save on your computer
 * Create a new website for your app in your webserver
 * Extract the contents of the .zip to your new website's home/root directory

The rest of these instructions are going to assume that you're somewhat familiar with Apache or IIS and can already get to the !ColdFusion Administrator. If you're really starting from scratch, google the "ColdFusion ACME Guide". It's a comprehensive guide to building a development workstation using Apache, ColdFusion MX 7, MySQL and Eclipse.

= Getting Wheels =

You have two choices when downloading Wheels. You can either use the latest official release of Wheels (0.6 at the time of this writing) or you can take a walk on the wild side and go with the latest committed source code in our Subversion repository.

To find the latest Wheels release you can go to the official website at www.cfwheels.com and go to the "Download" section. The SVN trunk is available at our Google Code site located at http://code.google.com/p/cfwheels.

So, "what should I get then" you might ask with a confused look on your face. Well, in most cases we recommend going with the official release since it's well documented and has been through a lot of bug testing. Only if you're in desperate need of a feature that has not been released yet would we advice you to go with the SVN trunk.

Let's assume you have downloaded the latest official release (really, you should go with this option) then you'll now have a .zip file saved somewhere on your computer. On to the next step...

= Webserver Setup =

Wheels is known to work with Apache and IIS. Just create a new website for your app however you'd normally do it. There is one very important decision to make here though - whether or not to use URL rewriting (yeah, those clean looking URLs that all the cool kids are using nowadays). If you intend to use URL rewriting then your default document should be index.cfm. If you're old skool and do not want URL rewriting then you should make the default document dispatch.cfm instead. If this is the first time you're creating a Wheels app we recommend not using URL rewriting for now and instead turn it on later.

= Installing Wheels =

This step is simple, just extract the contents of the Wheels.zip to your new website's home directory. Boom, you're done! Now go to http://localhost (or the domain you're using) and a nice "ColdFusion is on Wheels" page will be shown to you. 

= URL Rewriting =

Thanks to Wheels, most URLs are, with URL rewriting turned on, what we call "pretty"a - very easy to decifer and usually tell you, the developer, right where to look when you need to update something. 

Which do you think is prettier:
www.myapp.com/marketing/reports/sales_by_year
or
www.myapp.com/index.cfm?dept=marketing&action=reports&type=sales_by_year

These beautiful URLs come at a price, though. By default, Wheels needs to be at the root of the site. Meaning that you can't easily drop Wheels into the middle of an existing site and have it just know what to do. While this is possible, it's not for the faint of heart. It would require changes to a few rewrite rules which means intimate knowledge of regular expressions. These are found in .htaccess (for Apache) and IsapiRewrite4.ini (for iis). 

Wheels requires that Apache be configured to use url rewriting rules. To turn them on first find the following line in your httpd.conf file (the Windows default location is C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\conf):
#LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
Remove that pound sign (#) at the beginning to un-comment that rule and make it active.

Wheels requires that iis be setup with an isapi filter that rewrites urls. You’ll need to download this yourself from http://cheeso.members.winisp.net/IIRF.aspx Unzip this file and put the IsapiRewrite4.dll file somewhere good—you’re going to point iis to it.
To enable the ISAPI Rewrite Filter in iis you’ll go to the “Properties” dialog for your website and then go to the “ISAPI Filters” tab and click the “Add…” button. Type in anything you want as the “Filter Name” (“ISAPI Rewrite” will probably make the mose sense later) and point the “Executable” to the IsapiRewrite4.dll, 

There you go—installing Wheels in about ten pages. That wasn’t so hard, was it? On to chapter two where we start building an application.
