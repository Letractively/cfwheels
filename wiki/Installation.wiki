#summary Instruction for installing Wheels on Apache and IIS.

= Installation =

If you've ever installed a framework then you know it's generally pretty easy: copy a few files, maybe add a mapping in the !ColdFusion Administrator and you're off and running. Wheels is no different. If you've never installed a framework before, donâ€™t worry. You might even enjoy the process! All right, "enjoy" is a strong word. Maybe "tolerate".

We have tried to make it extremely simple to get up and running with Wheels - there actually only two things you need to do before you can start working on your app (although  you can tweak your installation later on by for example introducing URL rewriting and moving the Wheels core files out of your application's folder).

 * Get the latest Wheels release and save on your computer
 * Create a new website for your app in your webserver
 * Extract the contents of the .zip to your new website's home/root directory

The rest of these instructions are going to assume that you're somewhat familiar with Apache or IIS and can already get to the !ColdFusion Administrator. If you're really starting from scratch, google the "ColdFusion ACME Guide". It's a comprehensive guide to building a development workstation using Apache, ColdFusion MX 7, MySQL and Eclipse.

= Getting Wheels =

You have two choices when downloading Wheels. You can either use the latest official release of Wheels (0.6 at the time of this writing) or you can take a walk on the wild side and go with the latest committed source code in our Subversion repository.

To find the latest Wheels release you can go to the official website at www.cfwheels.com and go to the "Download" section. The SVN trunk is available at our Google Code site located at http://code.google.com/p/cfwheels.

So, "what should I get then" you might ask with a confused look on your face. Well, in most cases we recommend going with the official release since it's well documented and has been through a lot of bug testing. Only if you're in desperate need of a feature that has not been released yet would we advice you to go with the SVN trunk.

Let's assume you have downloaded the latest official release (really, you should go with this option) then you'll now have a .zip file saved somewhere on your computer. On to the next step...

= Webserver Setup =

Wheels is known to work with Apache and IIS. Just create a new website for your app however you'd normally do it. There is one very important decision to make here though - whether or not to use URL rewriting (yeah, those clean looking URLs that all the cool kids are using nowadays). If you intend to use URL rewriting then your default document should be index.cfm. If you're old school and do not want URL rewriting then you should make the default document dispatch.cfm instead. If this is the first time you're creating a Wheels app we recommend not using URL rewriting for now and instead turn it on later.

= Installing Wheels =

This step is simple, just extract the contents of the Wheels ZIP file to your new website's home directory. Boom, you're done! Now go to http://localhost (or the domain you're using) and a nice "ColdFusion is on Wheels" page will be shown to you.
