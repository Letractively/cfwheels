"Soft delete" in database lingo means that you set a flag on an existing table which indicates that a record has been deleted instead of actually deleting the record.

==How to Use Soft Deletion==

If you create a new date column (the column type will depend on your database vendor but usually you want to use `date`, `datetime` or `timestamp`) on a table and name it `deletedAt`, Wheels will automagically start using it for soft deletes. So, when in the past a [delete delete()] call on an object would have deleted it from the table using a `DELETE` statement now an `UPDATE` statement is sent instead (that sets the `deletedAt` field to the current time). Of course, all other Wheels functions are smart enough to respect this as well so if you use a [findAll findAll()] function, for example, it will not return any records that has a value set in the `deletedAt` field.

What it all means is that you're given a convenient way to keep deleted data in your database forever while having your application function as if the data is not there.

Obviously, if you have any manual queries in your application you'll have to remember to add `deletedAt IS NULL` to the `WHERE` part of your SQL statements.
