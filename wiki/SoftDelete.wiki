#summary An easy way to keep deleted data in your database.
#labels chapter

"Soft delete" in database lingo means that you set a flag on an existing table which indicates that a record has been deleted instead of actually deleting the record.

=How to use it=

If you create a new date field (the column type will depend on your database vendor but usually you wanna use `date`, `datetime` or `timestamp`) on a table and name it `deleted_at`, Wheels will automagically start using it for soft deletes. So, when in the past a `[delete]` call on an object would have deleted it from the table using a `DELETE` statement now an `UPDATE` statement is sent instead (that sets the `deleted_at` field to the current time). Of course, all other Wheels functions are smart enough to respect this as well so if you use a `[findAll]` method, for example, it will not return any records that has a value set in the `deleted_at` field.

What it all means is that you're given a convenient way to keep deleted data in your database forever while having your application function as if the data is not there.

Obviously, if you have any manual queries in your application you'll have to remember to add `deleted_at IS NULL` to the `WHERE` part of your SQL statements.

=Keeping the date only=

If you only care about what day the data was deleted and not the exact time you can name the field `deleted_on` instead of `deleted_at` and Wheels will do the same job as described above but without the time part.
