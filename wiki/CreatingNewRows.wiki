#labels model,tutorial
In Wheels one way to create objects that represent rows in our table is by calling the [new] class level method.

{{{
<cfset auth = model("author").new()>
}}}

We now have an empty author object that we can start filling in values for (corresponding to columns in the database).

{{{
<cfset auth.first_name = "Joe">
<cfset auth.last_name = "Jones">
}}}

At this point the `auth` object only exists in memory.
We save it to the database by calling it's [save] method.

{{{
<cfset auth.save()>
}}}

If you want to create a new object based on parameters sent in from a form request the [new] method conveniently accepts a struct as well.
As we'll see later, when you use the Wheels form helpers they automatically turn your form variables into a struct that you can pass into [new] and other methods.
Given that `request.params.new_auth` is a struct containing the `first_name` and `last_name` variables the below code does the same as the code above (without saving it though).

{{{
<cfset auth = model("author").new(request.params.new_auth)>
}}}

If you want to save it to the database right away you can use the [create] method instead.

{{{
<cfset model("author").create(request.params.new_auth)>
}}}

Note that we never have to set a value for the `id` attribute.
This is because we use the Wheels convention of having auto incrementing integer columns as the primary key.
After saving the object to the database the `id` attribute will be added to the object so you can check it by doing this.

{{{
<cfset auth = model("author").new()>
<cfset auth.first_name = "Joe">
<cfset auth.last_name = "Jones">
<cfset auth.save()>
<!--- Later on in your view file... --->
<cfoutput>#auth.id#</cfoutput>
}}}
