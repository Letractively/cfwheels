#summary What you need before you start programming in Wheels.
#labels chapter

We can identify three different types of requirements that you should be aware of; project requirements (is Wheels a good fit for your project?), developer requirements (do you have the necessary knowledge and mindset to program effectively in Wheels) and system requirements (is your server ready for Wheels).

=Project Requirements=

Before you start learning Wheels and making sure all the necessary software is installed on your computer you really need to take a moment and think about the project you intend to use Wheels on. Is it a ten page website that won't be updated very often? Is it a space flight simulator program for NASA? Is it something in between?

Most websites are at it's core simple data manipulation applications, you fetch a row, make some updates to it, stick it back in the database and so on. This is the target market for Wheels - simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) websites/applications.

A simple ten page website won't do much data manipulation so you don't need Wheels for that (or even ColdFusion in some cases). A flight simulator program will do so much more than simple CRUD work so in this case Wheels is a poor match for you (and so is ColdFusion).

If your website / application falls somewhere in between these two extreme examples, then read on, if not, go look for another programming language and framework ;)

Another thing worth noting right off the bat (and one that ties in with the simple CRUD reasoning above) is that Wheels takes a very data-centric approach to the development process. What we mean by that is that it should be possible to visualize the database design and implement it early on in the project's life cycle. So, if you're about to embark on a project with an extensive period of object oriented analysis and design which, as a last step almost, looks at how to persist objects, then you should probably also look for another framework.

Still reading?

Good :)

Moving on...

=Developer Requirements=
Yes, there are actually some things you should familiarize yourself with before starting to use Wheels. Don't worry though, you don't need to be an expert on any on of them, just a basic understanding is good enough.

- You should know the !ColdFusion programming language (surprise!).
- You should understand the concept of object oriented programming and how it applies to !ColdFusion.
- You should know the theory behind the Model-View-Controller development pattern.

*ColdFusion*
Simply the best programming language in the world! The best way to learn it, in our humble opinion, is to get [http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/ the free developer edition], buy Ben Forta's "[http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-ColdFusion-Web-Application-Construction/dp/0321223675/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5031277-7874448?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1185442723&sr=8-1 ColdFusion Web Application Construction Kit]" and start coding using [http://www.cfeclipse.org/ CFEclipse].

*Object Oriented Programming (OOP)*
This is a programming methodology that uses objects to design applications. Objects model real world entities in your application. It is based on several techniques, including inheritance, modularity, polymorphism and encapsulation. Most of these techniques are supported in ColdFusion making it a true object oriented language. At the most basic level a .cfc file in ColdFusion is a class and you create an instance of a class by calling the createObject method. Trying to squeeze an explanation of OOP and how it's used in !ColdFusion into a few sentences is almost impossible and a detailed overview of OOP is outside the scope of this chapter. There are lots of high quality information online though and a good starting point is [http://www.cfoop.org].

*Model-View-Controller*
The same 

=System Requirements=

ColdFusion on Wheels is based heavily on CFC's which were introduced in the "MX" version of ColdFusion so therefore you need at least ColdFusion MX 6 or higher (we recommend MX 6.1 or higher though).

This can be installed on Windows (XP, 2003 or Vista), Macintosh or Linux - they all work just fine with Wheels.

You also need a web server of course and the web servers we know for sure works with Wheels are Apache and IIS (5.1 and 6).
The built-in web server that comes with the ColdFusion installation should work too but this has not been confirmed so try at your own risk.

Finally, to build any kind of meaningful website or web application you will likely interact with a database.
Currently supported databases are SQL Server 7, SQL Server 2000 and MySQL 5.
Note that this only applies to the Full version, the Lite version does not interact with a database at all.
Also note that MySQL 4 is NOT supported.
