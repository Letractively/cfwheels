#summary Our listing of steps to take while upgrading your Wheels application from 0.7 to 0.8.
#labels 0.8,chapter

==File System Changes==

 * Change the `controller` folder to `controllers`.
 * Change the `model` folder to `models`.
 * Change the `view` folder to `views`.
 * Rename all of your CFCs in `models` and `controllers` to UpperCamelCase. So `controller.cfc` will become `Controller.cfc`, `adminUser.cfc` will become `AdminUser.cfc`, and so on.

==Database Structure Changes==

===MySQL===

 * Review your integer columns and make sure that they are not set as `UNSIGNED`. If so, remove this property because it will throw a ColdFusion error.

==CFML Code Changes==

===Model Code===
 * When using a model's `findAll()`, 'findById()`, and `findOne()` functions, the `found` property is no longer available. Instead, use ColdFusion's built-in `IsObject()` and `IsBoolean()` methods to determind if a record was found. If it was found, the return value will be an object; if not, it will return `false`.
