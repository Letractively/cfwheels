#summary Our listing of steps to take while upgrading your Wheels application from 0.7 to 0.8.
#labels 0.8,chapter

==File System Changes==

  * Change the `controller` folder to `controllers`.
  * Change the `model` folder to `models`.
  * Change the `view` folder to `views`.
  * Rename all of your CFCs in `models` and `controllers` to UpperCamelCase. So `controller.cfc` will become `Controller.cfc`, `adminUser.cfc` will become `AdminUser.cfc`, and so on.

==Database Structure Changes==

  * `deletedOn`, `updatedOn`, and `createdOn` are no longer available as auto-generated fields. Please change the names to `deletedAt`, `updatedAt`, and `createdAt` instead to get similar functionality, and make sure that they are of type `datetime`, `timestamp`, or equivalent.

==CFML Code Changes==

===Config Code===

  * In `config/settings.cfm`, remove the statements that set application.settings.paths values. We had to remove these option in order to hardcode the folders into the URL rewriting feature. Consequently, all images must be stored in `images`, files in `files`, JavaScript files in `javascripts`, and CSS files in `stylesheets` folders off of the root.

===Model Code===

  * When using a model's `findById()` and `findOne()` functions, the `found` property is no longer available. Instead, we've adopted the "Rails way" of doing this, which involves the function throwing an error of type "Wheels.RecordNotFound" if the record was not found. Use a `cftry`/`cfcatch` block to catch the error.
  * A model's `errorsOn()` function now always returns an array, even if there are no errors on the field. When there are errors for the field, the array elements will contain a `struct` with `name`, `fieldName`, and `message` elements.
