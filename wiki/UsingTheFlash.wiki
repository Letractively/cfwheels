#summary Using the Flash to pass data from one request to the next.
#labels chapter

The Flash is actually a very simple concept and no, it has nothing to do with Adobe's Flash player. The Flash is just a session variable with some added functionality - it is cleared at the end of the next page that the user views. This means it's a good fit for storing messages or variables from one request to the next.

=An example using the Flash=

The code below is commonly used in Wheels applications to store a message about an error in the Flash and then redirect to another URL which then displays the message in it's view page:

{{{
<cfset flash(error="Oops! Please correct your errors and try again")>
<cfset redirectTo(action="edit")>
}}}

In the view for the `edit` controller:

{{{
<p class="error-message"><cfoutput>#flash("error")#</cfoutput></p>
}}}

As you can see above you use a named argument (named `error` in this case) when you want to store data in the Flash and an unnamed argument when you want to get it back.

The `error` argument could have been named anything you wanted. For example you can use one name for storing error messages and one for storing success messages.

By the way, the name "Flash" comes from Ruby on Rails like so many other cool things in Wheels.
