#summary Use Wheels to get statistics on the values in a column.
#labels chapter,0.8

Since Wheels simplifies so much for you when you select, insert, update and delete rows from the database it would suck if you had to revert back to using `cfquery` and `COUNT(id) AS x` type queries when you want to get aggregate values, right? Well, good news... of course you don't have to do this, just use the built-in functions [sum sum()], [minimum minimum()], [maximum maximum()], [average average()] and [count count()].
