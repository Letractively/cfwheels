#summary Operating systems, web servers, databases and ColdFusion versions needed to run Wheels.
ColdFusion on Wheels is based heavily on CFC's which were introduced in the "MX" version of ColdFusion so therefore you need at least ColdFusion MX 6 or higher (we recommend MX 6.1 or higher though).

This can be installed on Windows (XP, 2003 or Vista), Macintosh or Linux - they all work just fine with Wheels.

You also need a web server of course and the web servers we know for sure works with Wheels are Apache and IIS (5.1 and 6).
The built-in web server that comes with the ColdFusion installation should work too but this has not been confirmed so try at your own risk.

Finally, to build any kind of meaningful website or web application you will likely interact with a database.
Currently supported databases are SQL Server 7, SQL Server 2000 and MySQL 5.
Note that this only applies to the Full version, the Lite version does not interact with a database at all.
Also note that MySQL 4 is NOT supported.
