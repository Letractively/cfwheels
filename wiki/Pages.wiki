#summary Rendering view pages to the browser.
#labels chapter,0.9.3

controller action decides what to render
this chapter is about where to place templates and what goes in them
normally html but can also be xml, javascript etc
templates live in the views folder
separate sub dir for each controller
templates correspond to action
not all controllers have views
you can have templates not belonging to actions though (maybe they are called from multiple actions)

describe some example and the diff between renderPage(action / template)

what goes in a template - just your regular cf code and some additions wheels constructs to help you keep things clean
has access to al vars set in the controller
incl the params but might be recommended to do that work in contrller
flash as well
try avoiding putting too much code into a template, keep them simple so a designer can work in them

partials
helpers
layouts
