#labels model,api,class
This is a class level method.
It deletes the row corresponding to the passed in `id`.
By default it will fetch the object first and call the [delete] method on it, thus invoking any callbacks you have specified for the model.
You can change this behavior by passing in `instantiate=false`, then it will just delete the row from the table using a simple `delete` query.
Returns `true` on successful deletion of the row, `false` otherwise.
