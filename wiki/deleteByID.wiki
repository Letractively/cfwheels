#labels api,model
Give this class level method a primary key value in the `id` argument and it will delete the corresponding row in your database table.
By default it will fetch the row first and call the object level `[delete]` method on it, [delete]() method, thus invoking any callbacks you have specified for the model.
You can change this behavior by passing in `instantiate=false`. Then it will just delete the row from the table using a simple `DELETE` query.
This method returns true on successful deletion of the row.
