==Face it==

At some point your code is going to break and the scary thing is it might not even be your fault. Upgrades, feature enhancements, bug fixes are all point of the development lifecycle and with deadlines and screaming managers you don't have the time to test the functionality of  your entire application with every change you make. Problem is; the today's fix could be tomorrow's bug. What if there was an automated way of seeing if that change you're making is going to break something? That's where writing tests for your application can be invaluable.

However, in the past testing meant downloading, configuring and learning a completely separate application. Often times this caused more headaches then it was worth and was the reason why more developers didn't write tests. With Wheels we've included a customized version of the RocketUnit Testing Framework to help address just this issue. Now writing tests for your Wheels application is part of the application itself and running the test is as simple as clicking a link.

==Running Tests==

Down in the debug area of your Wheels application (that grey area at the bottom of the page), you will notice a section called *Run Tests* with two links: *App* and *Core*. Also there is a *Test* link next to each installed plugin that you have in your application. Clicking the links will results in the following test to be run:

*App* - will run the tests that are located in `<your_app>/tests` folder you have created for your particular Wheels application. A suggestion would be to run these tests whenever you make changes to your application, are ready to publish it or upgrade your version of wheels.

*Core* - wil run the tests that the Wheels Team has created for the Wheels framework itself. Even though the Wheels Team makes considerable effort to make sure all tests pass, we can't account for everything. To help the Wheels Team, please take time to run these tests after downloading or upgrading your Wheels installation and report back any failures to us.

*PluginsTests* - will run the test written for a particular plugin. Although the plugin author will makes considerable effort to make sure all tests pass, they can't account for everything. To help them, please take time to run these tests after downloading or upgrading a plugin and report back any failures.
