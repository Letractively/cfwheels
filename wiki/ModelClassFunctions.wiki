#summary Listing of all model class methods.
#labels chapter,0.9

These methods operate on the class as a whole and not on individual objects and thus need to be prefaced with `model("name")`. You can call these methods from anywhere but it is *not* recommended to call them from view pages. When calling them from its own model file it is recommended to reference the scope explicitly with the `this` keyword.

==Examples==

`controllers/Blog.cfc`:

{{{
<cfset allAuthors = model("author").findAll()>
}}}

`models/Author.cfc`:

{{{
<cfset allAuthors = this.findAll()>
}}}
