#summary All functions in Wheels listed by category.
#labels chapter,0.8

All functions in Wheels fall into one of these six categories:

 * Model Initialization
 * Model Class
 * Model Object
 * View Helper
 * Controller Initialization
 * Controller Request

==Model Initialization==

These functions are called from the `init` function of your model files.

Example:

{{{
<cffunction name="init">
  <cfset hasMany("posts")>
</cffunction>
}}}

 * coming soon...
 * coming soon...

==Model Class==

These functions operate on the class as a whole and not on individual objects and thus need to be prefaced with `model("Name")`.

Example:

{{{
<cfset allAuthors = model("Author").findAll()>
}}}

 * coming soon...
 * coming soon...

==Model Object==

These functions operate on individual objects which means you first have to fetch or create an object and then call the functions on that object.

Example:

{{{
<cfset anAuthor = model("Author").findById(1)>
<cfset anAuthor.delete()>
}}}

 * coming soon...
 * coming soon...
