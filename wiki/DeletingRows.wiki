Deleting rows in Wheels is simple. If you have fetched an object you can just call its [delete] method.
If you don't have any callbacks specified for the model all that will happen is that the row will be deleted from the table and `true` will be returned.
If you have callbacks however, this is what happens:
First, the [beforeDelete] callback code is executed (if it exists).
If this returns `true` Wheels will proceed and delete the row from the table.
If false is returned from the [beforeDelete] callback processing will return to your code without any row being deleted (false is returned to you in this case).
If the row was deleted the [afterDelete] callback code is executed and whatever that code returns will be returned to you (you should make all your callbacks return true or false)

<cfset post = model("post").findByID(33)>
<cfset post.title = "New version of Wheels just released">
<cfset post.save()>
