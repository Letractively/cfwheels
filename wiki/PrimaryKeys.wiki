The convention in Wheels when it comes to primary keys is that they should be named `id` and be auto incrementing integers.
If you want to you can override this convention by specifying the primary key name like this:

`app/models/author.cfc`
{{{
<cfcomponent extends="cfwheels.model">
  <cfset setPrimaryKey("auth_id")>
</cfcomponent>
}}}

You can't override the fact that they have to be auto incrementing integers though.
The only time this rule does not apply is for tables you use to join [hasAndBelongsToMany] associations.
Those do not need an `id` primary key column but we'll get back to this later.
