Here is a sample application that covers how to setup validation rules
on a model, make a form for it, save to the database and so on.
The code is full of comments so it's a good way to learn Wheels if
you're one of those people who prefer playing around with code rather
than reading more abstract tutorials.

Instructions:

Create a new database with a table named "users" containing the
following columns:
id (int, primary key, not nullable, auto-incrementing)
firstname (varchar 100, not nullable)
lastname (varchar 100, not nullable)
email (varchar 100, not nullable)
password (varchar 20, not nullable)

Add a data source in the ColdFusion Administrator named
"cfwheelsUserAdministration" pointing to your new database.

Once that's all done just download, unzip and run the app (it comes
with Wheels 0.8.1 included).

Enjoy :)
