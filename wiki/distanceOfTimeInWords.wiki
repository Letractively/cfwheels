#summary Pass in two dates to this method and it will return a string describing the difference between them.
#labels method

If the difference between the two dates you pass in is 2 hours, 13 minutes and 10 seconds it will return "about 2 hours" for example. This method is useful when you want to describe the time that has passed since a certain event (examople: "Comment added by Per Djurner about 3 weeks ago") or the time left until a certain event (example: "Next chat sessions starts in about 5 hours") instead of just writing out the date itself.

Set include_seconds if you want a more detailed description when the time difference is less than one minute.
