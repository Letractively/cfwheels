When you have created or retrieved an object you can save it to the database by calling it's  [save()] method. If the object's primary key matches one in the database the contents of that row will be updated, if not, a new row will be inserted.

Example of getting a blog post from the database, updating it's title and saving it back:
{{{
<cfset post = model("post").findByID(33)>
<cfset post.title = "New version of Wheels just released">
<cfset post.save()>
}}}

You can also change the value of an attribute and save it to the database in one single call using [updateAttribute()] like this:
{{{
<cfset post = model("post").findByID(33)>
<cfset post.updateAttribute(title = "New version of Wheels just released")>
}}}
