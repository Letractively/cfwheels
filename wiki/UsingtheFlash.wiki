#summary Using the Flash to pass data from one request to the next.
#labels chapter,0.8

The Flash is actually a very simple concept and no, it has nothing to do with Adobe's Flash player. The Flash is just a struct in the session scope with some added functionality; it is cleared at the end of the *next* page that the user views. This means it's a good fit for storing messages or variables from one request to the next.

==An example using the Flash==

The code below is commonly used in Wheels applications to store a message about an error in the Flash and then redirect to another URL which then displays the message in its view page.

In a controller action that handles a form submission:

{{{
<cfset flashInsert(error="Oops! Please correct your errors and try again")>
<cfset redirectTo(action="edit")>
}}}

In the view page for the edit action:

{{{
<p class="error-message"><cfoutput>#flash("error")#</cfoutput></p>
}}}
