Intro text...

==Installing a Plugin==
Download a plugin ZIP file and drop it in the plugins folder (no need
to extract it).

==How to Uninstall a Plugin==
Delete the ZIP file (Wheels will clean up any left over files).

Naming:
Plugins will be named like this: URLObfuscator-0.1.zip
0.1 in this case is the version number of the URLObfuscator plugin.
If you drop both URLObfuscator-0.1.zip and URLObfuscator-0.2.zip
Wheels will use the one with the highest version number and ignore the
rest.

Creating a Plugin:
Besides being named like above there is only one requirement, it has
to have an "init" function which returns "this" and also sets
"this.version" to the Wheels version it is compatible with.

Compatibility:
When loading plugins Wheels will throw an error if the plugin is not
compatible with the installed Wheels version.
Wheels will also throw an error if two plugins are loaded and they
both override or add the same method causing a conflict.

To override a method in Wheels just create a method with the same name
in the plugin CFC file.
At the moment it's possible to override methods in Base, Controller
(incl view) and Model.
